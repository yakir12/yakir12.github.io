We&#39;ve invested years perfecting a very specific skill-set, so that you won&#39;t have to. Occasionally, the success of your research depends on mastering some technically challenging method. We offer our expertise in order to solve this problem and elevate your work. </p> <p>As our client, you will get a dedicated and skilled expert working on demand to complete the task as thoroughly and quickly as possible. Check out our skills to see if we can help you solve your specific problem. </p> <h1 id=why ><a href="#why" class=header-anchor >Why</a></h1> <p>In today&#39;s interdisciplinary research, expert knowledge is often required. Until now, this need has been answered by hiring a long-term postdoc, collaborating with an equally busy researcher, or learning the required skill yourself. While all three ways have their own merits, they can often be expensive, inefficient, and time-consuming. By decentralizing the more technical tasks in your research, you can manage your time more wisely. </p> <p>DataSturgeon offers a number of distinct advantages over these traditional models:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Speed</strong>: because we are dedicated to solve well-defined problems, completion times are relatively short.</p> <li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: we work on demand. You employ our expertise when it&#39;s needed and only when it&#39;s needed.</p> <li><p><strong>Tailored</strong>: no one is an expert in everything. DataSturgeon houses a selection of top researchers covering a wide range of skills.</p> <li><p><strong>Cost-efficient</strong>: because our experts have already attained the required skills, the job gets done in the most time-efficient way.</p> </ul> <h1 id=how ><a href="#how" class=header-anchor >How</a></h1> <p>Here is an example of how DataSturgeon might help a researcher in her work:</p> <blockquote> <p>Professor Dana studies hibernation in dragons. To do so she analyses their activity by filming them. This past summer, Dana was very successful and managed to record hundreds of dragons. While she used to analyse her videos manually, doing so now seems daunting at best. She could hire a post-doc who is a dragon expert, but in most cases they are not skilled in video analysis and would cost at least one-year&#39;s salary. Her collaborator, Professor Sam, is smart with programming and could help, but he&#39;s just left for a grand research expedition. With winter approaching, Dana doesn&#39;t want to miss recording her dragon&#39;s anticipated torpor. Here is where DataSturgeon comes in: Dana contacts DataSturgeon. Dana and DataSturgeon discuss what, why, and how to analyse her videos, and agree on a contract that includes a list of deliverables, a timeline, and a budget. DataSturgeon works on the videos, reporting to Dana on the progress of the work. To prevent any snooping, DataSturgeon is always confidential with all the materials. In the mean time, Dana records her dragons&#39; activities and torpor. DataSturgeon delivers the results to Dana on time, leaving another happy client.</p> </blockquote> <h1 id=who ><a href="#who" class=header-anchor >Who</a></h1> <p>I, Yakir Gagnon &#40;<a href="/pages/resume/">resume</a>&#41;, am a passionate, creative, skilled, and driven problem solver.
