## Experience

### CEO and Founder, [DataSturgeon Ltd](https://datasturgeon.com)
2017--now *Malmö, Sweden*

- Built end-to-end products for recording, storing, analysing, and viewing scientific research
- Managed limited resources under a tight schedule in my own company while serving international clients on 16 large projects
- Elevated scientific research by offering expert help to scientists with technically challenging problems

### Research Software Engineer, Beacon Biosignals
2022–-2023 *remote*

- Built profiling functionalities for monitoring streaming performance
- Ported a legacy streaming service to a new platform
- Identified and solved issues in a novel topological EEG plotting package

### Research Engineer & Researcher, Lund University
2019–-2022 *Lund, Sweden*

- Digitized and automated the data-analysis of the lab primarily using Julia, improving data-management and increasing the publication quality and quantity of all lab members in the group
- Awarded two years of fully financed research by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action (European Research Council) and VINNOVA for exploring vision in scallops
- Collaborated with scores of international, interdisciplinary, and remote researchers resulting in significant discoveries
- Supervised the research and career of MSc and Ph.D. students as well as Postdoctoral research fellows

### Researcher, University of Queensland
2013–-2016 *Queensland, Australia*

- Discovered what mantis shrimps use their circular polarization vision for – a sense that is now used to detect cancer in humans – by using binomial GLMM
- Built computational tools for the image-analysis of polarimetric data that are extensively used in the lab
- Modeled algorithms to describe how fish detect polarized targets, resolving all the remaining unanswered issues in the field of polarization vision
- Invented a superior method to visualize and represent the polarization of light, a method that has since been widely adopted by the scientific community

### Researcher, Duke University
2010–-2013 *Durham, NC, USA*

- Helped build a large virtual-reality arena for octopuses, designed graphical content to stimulate the animals with, preformed image-analysis on the camouflage of the animals
- Invented and built an automatic apparatus to accurately and efficiently measure the quality of lenses in animal eyes by using FFT, leading to followup-discoveries about visual acuity in deep-sea fish

## Education

### Ph.D. Integrative Zoology
2006–-2010 *Lund University*
Awarded the Venture Cup Southern Sweden, Fokus Verifiering, Innovation Prize, and Venture Cup Research Challenge for discovering a promising functional advantage for multifocal lenses inspired by nature

### MSc Marine Biology
2002--2006 *Lund University*
